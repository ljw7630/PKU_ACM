This folder is not a 'project'. It's a list of probblems I solve on poj.org and other acm website
There're all algorithm/data structure problems, including but not limits to: Array, Stack, Matrix, Tree, Graph, Dynamic Programming, etc.

Most of the code is written in C++, between year 2009 and 2010, when I was a sophomore student in Harbin Institute of Technology.

Each .cpp file correspond to a problem, e.g. 1001.cpp is the solution of http://poj.org/problem?id=1001

You can look into the problem description online at: poj.org/problem?id=*  (replace the * with a number shown on the file name)
