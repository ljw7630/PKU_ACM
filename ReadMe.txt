This folder is not a 'project'. It's a list of probblems I solve on poj.org and other acm website
There're all algorithm/data structure problems, including but not limits to: Array, Stack, Matrix, Tree, Graph, Dynamic Programming, etc.

Most of the code is written in C++, between year 2009 and 2010, when I was a sophomore student in Harbin Institute of Technology.
